Finn Mikkola's portfolio repository for projects

Here is a list of projects that I can made either in School or in the Jump Program.

capstone.ipynb was my capstone project in college. My classmates and I worked with proffesional company Intrusion looking at data for phishing websites. My model uses dynamic time warping to compare website traffic of known phishing sites, to other sites. It also looks at other factors such as peak traffic, date created, and how sharply the traffic declines after peak traffic. I unfortuatnly cannot share the original csv of data as I am not allowed to share it per requests of the Intrusion.
