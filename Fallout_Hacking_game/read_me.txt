This is just a fun little python project I did in honor of one of my favorite games Fallout. If you are unfamiliar with how it works: the goal of the game is to guess the right word from the list of words and characters printed out on the game start. After each guess the user will be told how similiar their guessed word is to the right word or 'password'. If you guess 4 times and dont get the right word you lose. If you guess the right word within 4 attempts you win and 'hack the terminal'

Bugs: Sometimes the messages dont print out? sometimes they do? no idea why
havent implemented the dud finder: if you find closed brackets within the code you can remove words in the orignal fallout hacking game
